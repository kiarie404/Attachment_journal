### improvements.
#### SEO
- definitions such as "donor funded Project Accounting Systems" should have IMS on the first page.
- googling all keywords associated with our products/ specialties should put IMS on the first page. --- that click should lea to the product page, not the home page.



#### UI
##### Home page
- one page setups, less scrolls (in both mobile and laptop screens).
- keep the footer {repeated menu, products, Clients add logos and js tally}
- Add mail, phone and instagram icons
- Add reviews from major brands eg UN-Habitat and Farmers choice.

- How about : on the upper slide, we slide the products instead ---- OK I take back my words

##### About page
 - The skills links lead to homepage, how about we lead them to js real life statistics. eg\
