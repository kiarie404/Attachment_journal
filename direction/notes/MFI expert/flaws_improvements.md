A site with simplicity : look at [this example](https://www.nklabs.com/)



*questions*
1. Is the MFI exert integrated with other financial parties other than Mpesa? - for example Equity?

### Login/Sign up page
1. The "read more" button in the login page leads to the home page.
2. So how does one really sign up?

### Homepage
1. The logo button just reloads the page.
2. The "home" button also reloads the same page. We could... <br>
   - remove it
   - make it to automatically scroll the homepage to the top (we just want to avoid the reloading)
3. Make the pictures to automatically scroll - all along I thought MFI was just for credit-only microfinance.\
   Let us make the first picture to be inclusive of : saccos, microfinances and Hirepurchase financing
4. Two brochure links are missing - we can do the error 404 page more gracefully.

###  [Credit only read more](https://mfiexpert.com/industries/credit-only-microfinance)
1. The challenges of microfinances have been made clear --- but how does IMS actually solve them?\
   For example, under the "Cost of outreach", no immediate solutions have been provided.\
   it would be better if the arrangement of that page would be : problem --> solution
   - we can use JS spinning boards here. + "our solution" button - that we there are optional links present


### [This page](https://mfiexpert.com/solutions/core-banking-platform)
1. Let the entire divs be links
