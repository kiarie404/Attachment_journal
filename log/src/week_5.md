Task Outline for week 5:
1. Finalize sanyiko.com SEO performance. From here on we make continuous little improvements.
2. Learn Native script for Mobile App development.
3. Learn Sanyiko App archiecture 

## Monday
- take care of how our pages are displayed in google searches
- Deal with local SEO settings(contacts, maps) --- plus submit site-map.
- Start learning native script.

## Tuesday
- continue learning nativeScript :
  - build a simple supermarket App. (using static data and avoid using HTTP APIs) {minimum 2 days work}

## Wednesday
I read and experimented with Nativescript. Got stuck on trying to read the guide documentation. Harsha helped me out.\
However, I decided to switch to React Native. Considering React Native has better documentation and a bigger support community when compared to Nativescript\
The Javascript family does not interest me at all. It does not rhyme with my programming style.\
So I settled for Flutter. It uses the Dart programming language. Statically typed, type-safe, design-first --- now that rhymes with my programming style. 

So yes, I will learn Flutter from here on.

## Thursday
- [x] Start Learning Dart Language that is used in Flutter

## Friday
In as much as Dart is easy & straight-foward, Flutter itself has a huge learning curve.\
I'm going back to Nativescript, At least the CSS and Javascript skills that I will learn there will be transferable to other areas of my programming life.

- [x] Learn CSS and learn it well. Learn it anew to avoid pointless float frustrations that take half your day .

## Saturday
- [x] Continue learning CSS.
