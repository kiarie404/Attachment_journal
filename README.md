# Attachment_journal
This is an attachment journal at IMS Guru.<br>
You can read it [here](https://kiarie404.github.io/Attachment_journal/)

This is better than recording events in a physical log book. Why?
- The integrity of the comments can be proven.
- The timing of the entries can be proven
- papers, printing is too much work.




### How the ebook is made.
I have used the [mdbook software](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to make this journal.\
You can read mdbook's documentation [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)

#### Why an e-book hosted on Github?
1. Reduces paperwork. The student doesn't have to print and scan a logbook.
2. The log book is now more portable. All that is needed is a web address.
3. More integrity is enforced because ;
    -  Using Git, the assessor/supervisor can know when an entry in the logbook was done.
4. The student can attach relevant url links - which is impossible to do with scanned papers.
5. ebooks are easier to edit. Editing physical papers is cumbersome (time, energy, peace of mind)
