*Fact* : I did not understand the sanyiko phone application well. <br>
I need help to understand the workflow of each user. That way, I will get to know the relevance of all these records and financial ledgers. I am in the dark.

***Tasks for the day***
- [ ] Inquire about the users of Sanyiko app
- [x] Determine each users workflow -- the one I have is vague, maybe we should create a user guide? and a developer documentation.
- [x] inquire about user guide
- [x] inquire about developer guide
- [x] Learn what IMS expert is
- [x] find IMS expert website flaws
- [x] Learn what MFI expert is, in preparation for tomorrow's login


***puzzling questions***
- Are there user guides for these apps?
- Are there developer documentation for these apps?
- What is the difference between MFI and IMS expert? Is it that MFI is an ERP focused on credid-only Microfinances?

***To Harsha...***\
Can we rebuild the Sanyiko App from scratch?
