# Thursday


*It has become clear that coding the user Interface is not my cup of tea.*<br>
*I will therefore build bare-minimum UIs and concentrate on the back-end*

tasks:<br>
- Build bare minimum pages.
- Ask Harsha to show you the Backend architecture.

*The deadline for publishing imsguru.com has been pushed to Monday 1st Aug 2022. So from here on I will concentrate on beta.imsguru.com*
