# Wednesday

*This is meant for tomorrow*
- [ ] Use Markdown and Mdbook to write documentation for the MFI Expert Application.
  - I will collaborate with Dennis, the MFI product manager, to create the user guide.
  - As for the developer documentation... that will wait. Ha ha ha.
- [ ] Launch the user guide as its own website : where users can access it, read it, print it or do whatever.
