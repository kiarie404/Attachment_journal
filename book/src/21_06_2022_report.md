### Features worth keeping under...
##### homepage
- "our products" segment remains in the main page, above "our projects"
- Latest projects upon a brief scroll down.
- keep the footer {repeated menu, products, Clients add logos and js tally}
- keep the UP-js button at the bottom of the page

##### About page
- maintain our history segment but let it come at the bottom of the page, above the footer
- maintain our portal segment
- maintain why us segment


### Possible improvements
#### UI
##### Home page
- how about we have one page setups, with less scrolls (in both mobile and laptop screens).
- keep the footer {repeated menu, products, Clients add logos and js tally}
- Add mail, phone and instagram icons
- Add reviews from major brands eg UN-Habitat and Farmers choice.

##### About page
 - Currently The skills links lead to homepage, how about we lead them to js real life statistics. eg
 
| Skill | action     |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Web hosting      | Visually display number of hosted clients, major brands on board, reviews     |
| Professional web design      | Visually display number of designed websites, major brands on board, reviews, links to major brands{increases our SEO}     |
