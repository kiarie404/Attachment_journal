# Week 2 Tuesday Report

[exit report?](week_2_tuesday.md)

I was to find suitable templates for Sanyiko.com\
Here are the ones I found :
1. [drayd -- 5 star](https://monsterone.com/wordpress-themes/dryad-gardening-company-wordpress-theme-o195604/) - Wordpress theme
2. [Wheat](https://monsterone.com/wordpress-themes/wheattico-crop-farm-responsive-wordpress-theme-o7489/) - Wordpress theme
3. [Farm](https://monsterone.com/wordpress-themes/seodo-agriculture-farming-foundation-wordpress-theme-o225877/) - CMS template. It looks like it has a bit of php.
4. [Children](https://monsterone.com/wordpress-themes/enora-charity-and-nonprofit-wordpress-theme-o212379/)

Considerations:
1. Must be wordpress based.
2. If the website is based on a single page, it should have fast screen loading. (I have not used tools to test the speed. Just plain sight)

Am starting to think that our priorities when re-making the website should be SEO-centric.

Concerning the SEO thread, I found [this](https://www.99signals.com/single-page-websites-seo/#:~:text=Single%20page%20websites%20are%20not,for%20a%20single%20page%20website.). Single page websites versus mutiple page websites on SEO.

TLDR :\
Concerning SEO, single page websites have advantages and disadvantages.

>***Advantages*** : Your SEO wins don't get scattered across multiple pages.\
>Domain authority of a website is mostly determined by the number of backlinks the site has been able to generate. <br>
>This works to the advantage of single page websites as all the links acquired by the site point to the same URL, meaning there will always be a 1:1 ratio of links to pages.

>***Disadvantage*** : Youâ€™ll have to compromise on keyword rankings.<br>
>Single page websites are usually developed around one main concept.\
>In this scenario, your ability to rank for a wide variety of keywords within the concept is quite limited.
