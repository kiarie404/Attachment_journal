- [x] Learn about wordpress SEO.
    - [x] learn the basics
    - [x] Check out different SEO tools ---- checked (Google search console, Google Analytics, AIOSEO, Yoast SEO)
    - [x] Check out Wordpress-specific tools (if possible)



So I managed to :
- Install and Navigate around the AIOSEO plugin
- Access Google search console
- Access Google Analytics
- Upload sitemap for indexing
- Edited search appearance 
- edited some perma-links
