# Wednesday

I read and experimented with Nativescript. Got stuck on trying to read the guide documentation. Harsha helped me out.\
However, I decided to switch to React Native. Considering React Native has better documentation and a bigger support community when compared to Nativescript\
The Javascript family does not interest me at all. It does not rhyme with my programming style.\
So I settled for Flutter. It uses the Dart programming language. Statically typed, type-safe, design-first --- now that rhymes with my programming style. 

So yes, I will learn Flutter from here on.
