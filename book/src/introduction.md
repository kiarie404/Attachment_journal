#### Why an e-book hosted on Github?
1. Reduces paperwork. The student doesn't have to print and scan a logbook.
2. The log book is now more portable. All that is needed is a web address.
3. More integrity is enforced because ;
    -  Using Git, the assessor/supervisor can know when an entry in the logbook was done.
4. The student can attach relevant url links - which is impossible to do with scanned papers.
5. ebooks are easier to edit. Editing physical papers is cumbersome (time, energy, peace of mind)
