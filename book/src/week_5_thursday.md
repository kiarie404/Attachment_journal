# Thursday

- [x] finish [this Flutter Tutorial](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) by today.
- [ ] Finish [this other Flutter tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/first-flutter-app-pt2#0)
- [x] Start Learning Dart Language that is used in Flutter


***Change of plans:***<br>
I will try to do both Nativescript and Flutter.\
I will build a simple App and compare the results btwn the 2 frameworks.



*Am starting to think that I should learn the Dart Language first. This tutorial has so much syntatic sugar*
