# Monday

*the imsguru.com came down with buggy error404 messages*\
*We spent the morning hours fixing the permalinks*\
*Afterwords we discussed with Harsha on the Rust programming language and how I would implement git-software using Rust*

Election results were to be announced on this day, so work ended early.
